# Project Rules & Safety Protocols

## Safety Protocols
- Always check git status before starting a complex task.
- If there are uncommitted changes, ask the user if they want to commit them first.
- If the task involves modifying more than 3 files, create a temporary backup commit automatically.
- When doing the auto commit, use simple short hand descriptions that still make sense.
