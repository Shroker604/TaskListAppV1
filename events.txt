Understood. I have read the instructions and will now follow the Stream of Thought protocol. I am ready to assist you. 
I'll start by exploring the project structure to understand how the theme is currently set up. I'll check the UI directory and the Main Activity. 
I'll update the task list to include the Dark Mode feature. Then I'll create an implementation plan to define the changes in MainActivity and the UI. 
I've drafted the implementation plan. I'll mark the planning step as complete and ask you to review the plan before I proceed. 
Plan approved. I'm starting the execution. First, I'll update MainActivity to manage the dark mode state. 
MainActivity is updated. Now I'm moving to TaskListScreen to add the toggle button and handle the theme switch. 
Implementation complete. I'm creating a walkthrough to document the changes and how to verify the dark mode toggle. 
Sure, I'll build the debug APK and install it on your connected device. This might take a moment. 
The build failed. I'm running a check to identify the compilation error. 
Still need more details. Running the build with info logging. 
The logs are being elusive. I'll manually inspect the code I just changed. 
I suspect the icon references are causing the issue. I'll correct them. 
Corrections applied. Retrying the installation now. 
Build failed again. I'm checking the project dependencies to verify the Material library version. 
It seems the icons I chose are not in the core library. I'll add the extended icons dependency. 
Dependency added. Retrying installation. 
I'm still having trouble with the icons. I'll temporarily switch to a known working icon to verify if that's the only issue. 
Placeholder icons in place. Running the build now. 
I'll restructure the header. The calendar button will get a proper calendar icon, and I'll move the dark mode toggle into a settings menu under the gear icon. 
I'm updating TaskListScreen.kt. I'll add the menu logic, switch the icons, and move the theme toggle into the dropdown. 
Header refactored. I'll verify the changes by creating a walkthrough and then I'll be done. 
Yes, absolutely. Git is the version control system. Every time we commit and push, we create a snapshot of your code at that point in time. You can always go back to previous versions if needed. 
Pushing your latest changes to GitHub now.
